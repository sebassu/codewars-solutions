# Build tower
Build a pyramid-shaped tower, as an `array`/`list` of `strings`, given a
positive `integer` **number of floors**. A tower block is represented with the
`"*"` character.

For example, a tower with `3` floors looks like this:
```C#
[
  "  *  ",
  " *** ", 
  "*****"
]
```
And a tower with `6` floors looks like this:
```C#
[
  "     *     ", 
  "    ***    ", 
  "   *****   ", 
  "  *******  ", 
  " ********* ", 
  "***********"
]
```
