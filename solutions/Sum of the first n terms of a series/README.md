# Sum of the first n terms of series
## Task:
Your task is to write a function which returns the sum of the following series
up to its n<sup>th</sup> term (parameter).

> Series: 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 + 1/16 +...

### Rules:
* You need to round the answer to `2` decimal places and return it as a
`string`.
* If the given value is `0` then it should return `0.00`.
* You will only be given natural numbers as arguments.

### Examples:
> `1` → `1` → **"1.00"**<br> 
> `2` → `1 + 1/4` → **"1.25"**<br>
> `5` → `1` + `1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13` → **"1.57"**
